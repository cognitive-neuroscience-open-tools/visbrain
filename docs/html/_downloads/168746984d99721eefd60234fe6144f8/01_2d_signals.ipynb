        "\n# Plot a 2D array of data\n\nDispose a two dimensional array of data into a grid.\n\nIn this example, we generate a dataset of EEG signals composed with 125 trials\nof 4000 time points each.\nAfter opening the interface, you should notice two layouts :\n\n* The first one, on the left composed with a grid of all of the 125 signals.\n  To be readable, the grid is re-arranged in a 25 rows by 5 columns of signals.\n  The first signal (0) is localized in the bottom left corner. The last signal\n  (125) is localized in the upper right corner. Finally, double click on a\n  signal to enlarge it.\n* The right panel can only display one signal but offer multiple plotting\n  forms (line, marker, histogram, time-frequency map, PSD)\n\n## Shortcuts\n\n* Mouse wheel on the grid canvas : zoom\n* Mouse press and hold : move the center of the camera\n* Double click on the grid canvas (left) to enlarge the signal\n* Double click on the signal canvas (right) to insert annotations\n* Press <delete> on both to reset the camera\n\n<img src=\"file://../../_static/examples/ex_2d_signal.png\">\n"
